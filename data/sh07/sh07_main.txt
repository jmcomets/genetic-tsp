#    This is an artificial example used to illustrate a paper.
#
#    The task was to locate 3 sources within the cities, so as 
#    to minimize the total of the distance from each city to its 
#    nearest source.
#
#    Minimizing solution 1:
#
#      sources in cities 4, 5, and 7
#
#      Total transportation distance 39.9
#
#    Minimizing solution 2:
#
#      sources in cities 1, 4, and 7
#
#      Total transportation distance 39.9
